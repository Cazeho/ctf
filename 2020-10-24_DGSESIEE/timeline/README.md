Disclaimer: as of writing, I am a full-time NEET creature, so I was free to spend a *lot* of time on this. This is also the first time I do a competitive timed CTF. I'm certain there are people who completed all challenges but spent less time than me overall, which is certainly more valuable!<a name="1b">[¹](#1)</a>

The purpose of this page is to keep it real - it's probably not the best idea to spend that much time on a CTF. I had fun, though!

For some reason, I picked up the habit of keeping track of my time in a big spreadsheet. I'm sure I'll find a real use for it some day, but it comes in pretty handy when I need to figure out what I was doing at any given time.

Saturday 24
-----------

I should have gone to sleep a couple hours earlier, but stayed up to see what the challenge was.

And then I was hooked.

Sunday 25
---------

Woke up at 8am, (technically 9 hours of sleep because of DST). I was feeling a bit discouraged from seeing how fast some of the hard challenges were solved, so I started slacking a little. I stopped early at night to catch a stream that I was looking forward to.

Monday 26
---------

Another slow start; I woke up at 8:45 but only started working at 12:05, taking a 1h break in the afternoon to chat with a friend, and another 1h break to clean my room and shower, so I could feel less like roadkill.

At this point I had attempted every single challenge besides Evil Cipher, and was only left with things I was stuck on.

#### Challenges completed:

* [VX Elliptique](../250_vx_elliptique)
* [Steganosaurus](../400_steganosaurus)
* [Stranger RSA](../200_stranger_rsa)

Come midnight, I didn't feel like stopping, so I filled up my biggest coffee mug, emptied the sugar tray and settled down for an all-nighter.

Tuesday 27
----------

I had a very nice 6 hours of focused coding for Evil Cipher (well, more like 2 hours coding / 4 hours debugging). Then lack of sleep started to catch up with me, and I lost a lot of time on Automatos randomly guessing before forcing myself to reason to the correct solution.

At 8:30 am, the only challenge I had left was ChatBot, I still had absolutely no idea how to do it, and I had to leave in 1h for an appointment,  nd started bruteforcing - which as it turns out was ...what you were supposed to do for this challenge?

<a name="1">[¹](#1b)</a>: That being said, when it comes to puzzle-solving, there's this interesting phenomenon where your subconscious keeps solving things while you're doing something else. Often, by the time you come back to a puzzle you've taken a long break on, you suddenly come up with a bunch of new ideas, seemingly out of nowhere. So, time spent not working also counts to some degree! Don't underestimate the power of a good night's rest².

²: But also if you never sleep you get ahead of everyone else by 8h every day. So. (/s)
